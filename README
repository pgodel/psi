README
------

PSI - PHP Simple Informer is a very simple network services monitoring application written in PHP. It can be run as a command line application (PHP compiled as cgi is required) or as a web php file.

Although is very simple, it does its function very well. Is very easy to configure with a single file and a couple of simple lines.

I don't know if this is going to be useful for anybody, but it's for me. I have been testing several applications, and all of them are more complex that what I need or they don't perform so simple tasks.

FEATURES
--------
- Very simple installation and configuration: one single config file and done.
- Multiple hosts configuration
- Support for special features for services: mysql, http, https.
- Multiple contacts configuration
- Alerts are sent by email or with an executed external command.
- Logs issues to log file.
- Report / status web page.

CHANGELOG
---------
- 1.6 : Fixed bug reading CPU load
        Added support for openvz dmesg fatal error messages
- 1.5 : Fixed bug which prevented succesful connection to lighttpd web servers.
- 1.4 : Send one email per contact for multiple events in one run.
		Path to php binary changed to /usr/bin/php to accomodate more common installations.
		Renamed psi.conf to psi.conf.dist to not overwrite user configuration.
		Moved from_email setting to psi.conf file.
		Added list of processes to CPU load and process count alerts.
	
- 1.3 : Support for PHP 5.x
		Added support for CPU load, process count, and web page change.
- 1.2 : Added FTP support

INSTALLATION
------------
- Unpack the file psi-1.5.tar.gz in your desired final location:
$ gunzip -c psi-1.5.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd psi

- Configure psi.conf (Read the info and examples inside the file)
$ vi psi.conf

- And run psi.php (php compiled as a cgi or CLI and placed in /usr/local/bin/php is required)
$ ./psi.php

- Place it in crontab to run it periodically, i.e.: */1 * * * * root /usr/local/psi-1.5/psi.php > /dev/null 2>&1

- link www to your web root directory to be able to access the web reports.

FAQ
---
1) What is PSI - PHP Simple Informer ?
It's a very simple and basic network services monitoring application. It can check tcp ports for the moment.

2) Why is written in PHP ?
Because it's a great scripting language and I love it! Simple, fast to write and very powerful! 
More info at http://www.php.net

3) Why another network services monitoring program ?
Because all of the available applications are more complex that what I need or they don't perform so simple tasks. I don't know if this application is useful for anybody, but it is for me.

4) When I set to receive alters by emails, I never receive them.
Check that PHP is properly configured to use a mail delivery system (sendmail?) in the php.ini file. Test the following quick script to see if PHP sends emails correctly:

<?php 
	mail("me@domain.com", "Test", "Testing");
?>
And watch your email log files to see if the email is sent correctly.

5) Why this page sucks?
Because I don't have time to put it better.

BUGS
----
Probably not much because the program is so simple. But if found, report to pablo@godel.com.ar 

TODO
----
If I get spare time, I will add more features like:
- Add additional special services.
- Logging to a file or maybe a DB to have a history and be able to make graphics (partially implemented).
- Create a webpage to check the status (done, maybe enhanced).
- Create a web-based administration interface (pending).
- Any more ideas?
